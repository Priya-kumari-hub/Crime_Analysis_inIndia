# About the Project

This project provides a RESTful API service that offers detailed crime analysis data for Indian states, with a special focus on crimes against women. The API exposes multiple endpoints to retrieve state-wise statistics about various crime categories, gender-wise victim data, and yearly crime trends from authentic and processed datasets.

The aim is to empower developers, researchers, and policymakers by making crime data easily accessible and machine-readable, supporting data-driven decisions, research, and visualization in web or mobile apps.

## Features

State-wise Crime Data: Detailed crime statistics related to different categories of crimes against women.

Gender-wise Victim Data: Breakdowns of crime victims by gender and age.

Yearly Crime Trends: Historical crime data across years (2020, 2021, 2022) for each state.

Simple REST API: Easy-to-use API endpoints for quick integration.

JSON Response: Well-structured JSON output for all queries.

Case-insensitive Queries: State names can be queried regardless of letter case.

## How It Works

The API loads pre-processed CSV datasets on startup (df_women.csv, df1.csv, and df2.csv).

When a client sends a GET request to an endpoint with a state name, the API:

Filters the dataset(s) for that state.

Returns the relevant crime statistics or trend data.

Sends a JSON response with the requested information.

If the state is not found, an error message is returned.
